   npm install
   or
   yarn install
   
   expo start
   or
   yarn start
   ```
   
## Folder Structure

      ✅ Search Screen: Allows users to search for weather information in different locations.
      ✅ Bookmarks Screen: Allows users to view weather information for saved locations.
      ✅ React Navigation: Implements navigation between the Home and Search screens using React Navigation.
      ✅ Error Handling and Loading States: Implements proper error handling and loading states during data fetching.
      ✅ Weather Information: Displays key weather information, including temperature, humidity, and weather conditions.
      ✅ Temperature Unit Toggle: Allows users to toggle between Celsius and Fahrenheit.
      ✅ State Management: Uses state management techniques, such as React Context or Redux, to manage the application state.
      ✅ 3-Day Forecast: Includes a 3-day forecast on the Home screen.
      ✅ Weather Icons: Adds icons or images to represent different weather conditions.
      ✅ Favorite Locations: Implements a feature to add favorite locations and view their weather information.

## Additional Notes
   ```bash
   - The app uses AsyncStorage for storing bookmarks locally.
   - The default location is set to Lagos, Nigeria.
   - The styling is handled using shopify-restyle and css.   
   - Redux is employed for state management, allowing efficient data flow between components.
   - The app periodically fetches bookmarked locations' weather data in the background.
```

## Possible Improvements
```bash
- Implement user authentication to provide a personalized experience.
- Enhance the UI/UX for a more polished look.
- Implement more advanced weather features and forecasts.
```
